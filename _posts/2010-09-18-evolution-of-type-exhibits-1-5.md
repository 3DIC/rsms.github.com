<blockquote>
  <p>When my eyes crossed [an] excerpt of famous type designer Frederic W. GoudyÂ´s &#8220;The Alphabet and Elements of Lettering&#8221; (1918) suddenly letters full of life showed in my mind&#8217;s eye. Letters are organisms and typefaces are the species, all classified similar to biological taxonomy! I drafted this cognition in a chart for print and in order to prove my finding to the interested audience I took one step further. I surgically opened the letters S, Z, S, A, W and how contented I was to discover muscles, veins, tendons and bone just like the ones shared by so many living creatures.</p>
